# AI Agents for Sustainability (A4S)

**One-liner:** An open-source, carbon accounting + ESG assistant that helps SMEs measure, report, and reduce emissions using agentic AI.

## Problem

Most small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) lack budget, tools, and in-house expertise to do credible carbon accounting and ESG reporting. Data is fragmented across bills, sensors, travel logs, and operations, and Scope 3 is especially hard. Consultants are expensive; off-the-shelf platforms are complex and over-built.

## Solution

**A4S** is a lightweight app that turns messy operational inputs into auditable carbon metrics and practical reduction plans. It calculates **Scope 1, 2, and 3** emissions, generates **ESG-ready summaries**, provides **localized guidance**, and maps requirements across jurisdictions (e.g., CBAM-adjacent trade considerations, national ETS developments).

## How it works (Agentic workflow)

1. **Data Entry Assistant** – Classifies activities (e.g., diesel gensets, electricity) into the correct scope/category and validates required fields and units.
    
2. **Report Summary Agent** – Converts tables into human-readable ESG narratives with key trends, hotspots, and baselines.
    
3. **Offset Advisor** – Recommends a balanced portfolio of credible, geographically relevant offset options to close residual gaps.
    
4. **Regulation Radar** – Surfaces applicable rules (home country + export markets) and upcoming changes; suggests compliance steps.
    
5. **Emission Optimizer** – Produces tailored abatement suggestions (operational efficiency, fuel switching, procurement, behavior).
    

## Product features (MVP)

- **Dashboard:** Totals by scope, category, and over time (Plotly charts).
    
- **Data input:** Manual form + CSV upload; session-state storage (JSON now; DB plug-in ready).
    
- **Multilingual UI:** English/Hindi to widen adoption.
    
- **Export:** ESG-ready summaries and PDF report generation.
    

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit.
    
- **Agents & Orchestration:** CrewAI with Groq-hosted Llama 3.3 “Versatile”.
    
- **Data:** Local JSON/CSV (extensible to SQL); emission-factor hooks per country.
    
- **License:** MIT; GitHub repo open for community PRs.
    

## Why this matters (SME focus)

- Lowers the barrier to **credible measurement** and **actionable reduction**, not just disclosure.
    
- Aligns with **SDG 9 (Industry & Innovation), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action)**.
    
- Meets investor and supply-chain transparency pressures without enterprise-grade cost/complexity.
    

## Safeguards & integrity

- Clear separation between **measurement, reduction, and offsets** (offsets only for residuals).
    
- Country-specific emission factors with provenance slots; verification status tracked (**unverified / internal / third-party**).
    
- Transparent prompts and logs for auditability; privacy by default (local storage, opt-in cloud).
    

## Roadmap (select)

- Database plug-in (Postgres), organization workspaces.
    
- API endpoints for ERP/utility bill ingestion; sensor CSV templates.
    
- Multi-jurisdiction rulepacks (e.g., CBAM data requirements, national ETS).
    
- Benchmarking: anonymous intensity metrics by sector/region.
    
- Assisted data cleanup (OCR & invoice parsing) and provenance trails.



## What we’re asking from the GlobalSustainability Challenge

- **Pilot access** to SME cohorts and sustainability mentors.
    
- Support to **localize emission factors** and compliance checklists.
    
- Micro-grants/credits to cover hosting and third-party verifications for pilots.
    

**Outcome:** A practical, open, and culturally accessible pathway for SMEs to quantify, report, and _actually reduce_ emissions—turning ESG from a burden into a continuous improvement loop powered by agents.
